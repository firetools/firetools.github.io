## qgis2fds at a glance

**qgis2fds** is an experimental project still subject to huge modifications.

## Terrain and landuse for FDS simulations

qgis2fds allows you to seamlessly prepare **terrain elevation** and **land-use data** for wildfire and atmospheric pollutant dispersion simulations, directly from within QGIS.

You can:

- extract and process **digital elevation models** (DEM) to generate realistic terrain for FDS domains;

- incorporate **land-use and vegetation layers** to define surface characteristics relevant to fire spread or pollutant transport;

- **export** simulation-ready input files, eliminating manual preprocessing and ensuring consistency with geospatial sources.

Designed for **fire safety engineers**, **environmental scientists**, and **students**, qgis2fds leverages the powerful GIS capabilities of QGIS to streamline the setup of complex simulations in FDS.

## What is QGIS?

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is a free and open-source **geographic information system** (GIS) used to view, edit, analyze, and visualize geospatial data. It supports a wide range of vector, raster, and database formats, making it a powerful tool for mapping and spatial analysis.

## License

QGIS and qgis2fds are both **free software**.

qgis2fds was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

## Financing

During 2020â€“2021, the development was supported by a **grant** from the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/it/).

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intended to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of **wildland-urban interface fires** propagation.
