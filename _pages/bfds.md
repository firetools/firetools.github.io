## BFDS at a glance

**BFDS** is the successor to the **BlenderFDS** project — a community-driven initiative first presented at the Blender Conference 2009 and continuously developed since then.

## Full control

BFDS doesn’t hide the complexity of [NIST FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/): you remain in **full control** of the FDS input file.

Designed for **fire safety engineers**, **researchers**, and **students**, BFDS lets you focus on your fire simulations instead of wrestling with the setup of **complex geometries**. With Blender’s powerful 3D tools, you can build and edit FDS entities directly in a familiar environment.

You can also **import existing FDS input files** or CAD files and quickly adapt them to your needs.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline from modelling to visualisation. BFDS is developed as a Blender add-on. 

## License

Blender and BFDS are both **free software**.

BFDS was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

## Financing

![logo-maeci](/assets/images/logo-maeci.jpeg){: .align-left}

During 2020–2021, the development was supported by a **grant** from the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/it/).

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intended to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of **wildland-urban interface fires** propagation.
