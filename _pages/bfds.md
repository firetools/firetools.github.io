**BFDS** is the successor to the **BlenderFDS** project — a community-driven initiative first presented at the Blender Conference 2009 and continuously developed since then.
{: .notice--info}

## BFDS, full control over the FDS input file

**BFDS** is a [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/) add-on that makes it easy to create and manage [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) models. You can also import CAD models and existing FDS input files, and quickly adapt them to your needs.

Instead of entering complex geometry by hand, you can use **Blender’s powerful 3D tools** to build and edit FDS entities directly in a familiar environment.

Designed for **fire safety engineers**, **researchers**, and **students**, BFDS helps you focus on your fire simulations instead of struggling with the geometry setup.

## What are FDS and Blender?

[**NIST FDS**](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) is an open source large-eddy simulation (LES) code for simulating low-speed flows, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

[**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline from modelling to visualisation.
